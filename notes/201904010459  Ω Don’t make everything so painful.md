# Don’t make everything so painful 
(33)

Don't dwell on regret or worry, foreshadowing the future. If there is a pain to your future, then this type of activity inflicts it twice, and at least one of those times, you suffer voluntarily. Don't suffer your suffering.  

Your regret and worry can affect how you treat yourself and others. Things can be bad enough without festering them with an attitude of regret and worry, making demoralizing mental comments to yourself and out loud, without the negative feelings associated with contraction, and of course, our old nemesis, gossip. Work with what is happening without faultfinding or complaining or elaboration. Don't get angry. Wallowing in regret and worry only makes things worse. 'Don't put a head on top of your head. One head is enough.' Do this for others. Do this for yourself.  

Confidence is undermined by focusing on regret and worry. Use the feelings of regret and worry as the wake-up bells for waking up and returning to the present moment experience. Just put regret and worry down and begin again. You can either learn from your regret and worry or turn them into another stick to beat yourself.

Build confidence through small actions, remind others of their adequacies.
