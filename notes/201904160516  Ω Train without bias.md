# Train without bias 
(48)

Without bias means not to make excuses. Train on every object without preference. Both in meditation and in post-meditation. Training must be broad and deep. Train wholeheartedly and constantly. Be all out in the open. Be in the world for the benefit of others. This is also Stoic in nature. 

Train when it is fun. Train when frustrated. Don’t follow the ego into the realm of practice. It has its own ideas of what it wants to do. Don't divide life into parts. Don't hold back. Nothing is off limits. 'Everything is the pallet for mastery. This is what practice is and how it’s done. Remember all that you encounter--intended or inconvenient--is an opportunity for practice.'

Don't give yourself the refuge of not practicing with everything. 

Keep the pressure on. Everything that happens is fodder for the mill of Mind Training. Every aspect of your life is a practice opportunity. Whatever you ignore or overlook will consume you.
