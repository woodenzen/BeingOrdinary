# Keep tract of the three key elements
(46)

Don't lose track of what? What is being referred to here are the three key elements that form the foundations for a healthy practice. Framed as once developed, however imperfectly, don't let them wane. Keep tract. They are expressed as devotion, appreciation, and discipline. 

In a healthy practice you look to: 

1. Receive guidance from a qualified spiritual mentor
2. Assemble physical and social conditions for practice
3. Devote yourself to all stages of practice

Remain vigilant for laps in devotion, appreciation, and discipline.
Pay attention to the ups and downs of your inspiration.
Here the corresponding admonishments are:

1. Be devotion to your spiritual friend
2. Be grateful for the Mind Training slogans
3. By conducting yourself with grace and dignity

Be vigilant in how you conduct yourself in order to keep tract of the three key elements.
