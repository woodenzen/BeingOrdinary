# Be consistent in your practice 
(53)

Be consistent. Be kind. Be confident. Go all in! Be a tortoise.

You vacillate, telling yourselves you can’t do this or that, that you’re this way or that way is better, that others are like this or like that. Really? Consistency matters. In fitness, in writing, in relationships, in any project, including the project of life and training the mind. 

When working on the project of dropping self-grasping and developing loving kindness. "Ask yourself the following questions: Is impermanence true or not? Is sickness, old age and death true or not." [^@Fischer2013:aa]

Be consistent. Don't vacillate in your enthusiasm for practice. Make single-pointed commitment to Mind Training and stick to it. Always keep the practice of Mind Training in mind. Just because practice of Mind Training is sometimes hard is not an excuse to slack off. Hard is just a point on a spectrum. Everyone has something hard in their life. Have compassion for them. Even if the "them" is you.

Do you want to vacillate between various strategies or find a balance point that you can maintain over the long term, years? There are 'Switching Costs' to vacillating in your enthusiasm for your practice and for dabbling in other practices. When switching practices there is naturally a new learning process with each switch. You are a beginner in that practice. Constantly switching leaves you in the perpetual beginner stage, never developing.
