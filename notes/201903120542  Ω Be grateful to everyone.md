# Be grateful to everyone 
(13)
 
It is impossible to awaken to enlightenment without others. Enlightenment depends upon others. Everyone has a lesson to teach you. Without those people who you struggle to be grateful for, you would not have anything to work with, you wouldn't be shown your triggers, your barriers from acceptance. You could not grow into an awakened state. This slogan is about the expression of gratitude towards everyone, with no exceptions. This can be hard. 

We are all human and are connected. Everyone is your teacher. All good positive feelings you've ever had or will ever have are the result of the actions of others. For this, they have expressed vast kindness. Every strong reaction to somebody provides an opportunity for practice. All the positive lessons you've ever learn or will ever have are the result of others triggering your egotistic self-grasping. 

Your fears and self-doubts are rubbed by those who interact with you, releasing potentials in you, you never thought you had. Be grateful to everyone because you never know when someone, intentionally or not, says or does something that quenches your egotistic self-grasping setting you free. It is helpful to remember that at different times we have been, intentionally or not, a positive influence in someone's life and a negative one. The negative interactions often turn out to be the most powerful learning and growing ones. Every interaction provides an opportunity for acceptance and gratitude. 

"Literally every thought in our minds, every emotion that we feel, every word that comes out of our mouth, every material sustenance that we need to get through the day, comes through the kindness of and the interaction with others. And not only other people but nonhumans too, literally the whole of the earth, the soil, the sky, the trees, the air we breathe, the water we drink." [^@Fischer:2013aa]
