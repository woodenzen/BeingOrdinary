# Always train with the slogans 
(9)

The original slogan is: "In all activities, train with slogans."

This mind training slogan is a reminder that the mind training slogans are practical and apply to everything that you do in every situation. 

There is nothing in your experience that isn't touched and manipulated with your mind. You make exaggerated stories of your experiences and then form emotive stories about these caricatures. Applying the mind training slogan has a knock-on effect on everything else you experience and do.

Mind training is available in every circumstance. During your everyday activities, you and stop for a moment and notice, breathe in pain and suffering, and breathe out joy and compassion. You have to breathe anyway, may as well use your breath to spread love and benefit all beings.

**Practice giving happiness and taking on troubles.**

Study the slogans continuously. Let this be a reminder that you should keep the brakes off and apply full effort in everything you do. As you learn about mind training, you'll be surprised when appropriate slogans spontaneously arise. They'll well up, figuratively, from a deeper part of the heart-mind. When a random mind training slogan wells up, it will seem like the magical mystery that it is.  

You have to congratulate yourself for getting this far in the study of mind training. Mind training is like sculpting. It chisels away at the self-grasping ego and progresses slowly and is undefined at first, and as you do it, you gain strength and confidence. Any time you shine the light on your ego, the ego reacts in childish and non-health ways. 

In applying the study of mind training to your daily life, remember to keep a sense of humor. Keep your mood light and airy. Approach your problems with an air of adventure. Problems will always arise. To expect otherwise is to be a fool. The problems will only stop once you die, so look to your problems with heartfelt gratitude that you can still work with them. 

Then do your best!
