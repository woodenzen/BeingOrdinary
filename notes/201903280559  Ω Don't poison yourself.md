# Don’t poison yourself 
(29)

This slogan is not about dietary restrictions. It is about holding on to the self, about how we feed the ego about watching out for what is nourishing and what is not. The poisons cover food, drink, thoughts, emotions, and even spiritual practices.  

'Wholesome deeds performed with selfish aims are just like poisoned food.' How you feed your motivation is very important. Watch for the appearance of poison creeping into your motivation. You can become poisoned before you realize it. Shore yourself up with the antidote of practice. Having self-grasping ignorance and the self-cherishing attitude comes naturally through the process of living life. Instead of following these habits, say, "No, thank you, I don't eat that stuff anymore; I know it's bad for me. It holds me captive."

Watch not to poison our motivation.

* Feeling superior to others
