# Let confusion awaken and practice emptiness 
(14) 

Originally "Seeing confusion as the four _kayas_ is unsurpassable _shunyata_ protection."

Let's break this down and look at the confusion and what it tries to protect us from. 

Underneath the technical jargon, this slogan is about interdependence and how your ordinary mind is already Buddha mind. _Kayas_ represent the progression of the evolution of our perceptions. This progression from confusion to awakening traditionally is defined in Buddhism with the four _Kayes_. 

1. dharmakaya - begins with uncertainty and openness
2. nirmanakaya - your perception then starts to come into focus
3. sambkogakaya - then develops energy and begins to come together
4. svabhavikakaya - synthesizes into the immediate present-moment experience

_Shunyata_ is referred to in Buddhism as emptiness. The background of being. That place before thoughts and feelings. That place (which is no place) where your thoughts dissipate when you notice them. Sometimes mistakenly called _the center_. But it has no location. This is what is meant by emptiness. 

All of reality erupts from this _place of emptiness_. Your mistake is to take what appears as reality and make it separate, reliable, and unchanging. You separate perceptions into subject and object - you the subject and the world the object. This reinforces the ego and causes of confusion. What this slogan tells you is that even this confusion and the associated suffering erupts from the same _place of emptiness_. 

Both object and subject are illusory, arising from emptiness and residing in emptiness and returning to emptiness. Seeing the arising, residing, and disappearing of experience is what is meant by awakening confusion. Don't worry or stress about this. The nature of the universe is just like this, arising, residing, and returning, drop it, and rest in emptiness. 

All experience is both vivid and empty, arising and returning to that _place of emptiness_. There is no hanging on to experience, no matter how much you try.  Experience your life this way. Practice awakening paired with letting go. 

Practice emptiness means you practice with the ultimate Bodhicitta. The nature of the universe. Don't worry or stress about this. Just see all your confusion as to the path and continue to sit and investigate. Indeed this is your best protection. 

"In other words, you can just drop it. Out of the blue, you just drop it.
The world opens up and suddenly you're there for what's happening." [^@Chodron:1994a]
