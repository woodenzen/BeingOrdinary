# Don't make a public display of your efforts
(24)

The original slogan is: "Change your attitude, but remain natural."

It would be beneficial to lose the attitude that you are more important than others. Realize that it's important not to get caught up in any big-dealness of your effort. This means not showing off. Don't be a phony inflating your pride at the expense of others. Try and be less lame. Blend in more and avoid standing out. Ripen your mind by changing your self-cherishing and ego-clinging attitudes and behaviors.

There are many cases when overt wholesome action is appropriate, but be discreet without calling attention to yourself. Look at your attitude and behaviors and see if you are feeling superior or acting prideful. Use that feeling as an object of meditation. Dive into your actual experience and watch those feelings morph and evaporate like clouds in the sky. 

When mind training practice with little fanfare but a great passion. This balance of showing little fanfare and having enthusiasm amid a busy life is hard to achieve. Be cheerful while remaining as natural as possible, keeping your manners and conduct like those around you. Blending in makes you appear ordinary. This is the work that needs to be done to nurture and mature your experience without making others aware of your efforts. This is what it means to practice in secret. Practice not in a deceptive way but in a quiet, gentle way.

This slogan calls on us not to put on an external show.  It attracts attention and creates a reputation; let your acts be the antidote to self-cherishing, ego-clinging, and defiled emotions. You should bring your mind to ripeness without anybody knowing.

   * Act without hypocrisy 
   * Mind training without anyone knowing
   * Emulate friends
   * Be discreet even secretive
   * Have pure motivation
   * Only the welfare of others matters
   * Be a hidden yogi

Being decent and secretive provides a deep sense of relaxation. It only requires taming your mind so that you are not continually pushing other people around. Instead of cherishing yourself, you love others - and then you just relax. That's it. 

This slogan targets one attitude in particular: the opinion that you are more important than others. This kind of attitude adjustment seems like a pretty big deal, heroic even. Yet it's straightforward. Combine the radical challenges of slogan practice with the relaxing into anonymity.
