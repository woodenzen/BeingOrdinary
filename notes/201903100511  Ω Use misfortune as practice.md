# Use misfortune as practice
(11)

The original slogan is: _"When the world is filled with evil, transform all mishaps into the path of bodhi."_

Work with whatever happens. When caught in bad situations, take those various things and turn them into the tools used to awaken. The word _bodhi_ means awakening. Life situations are like a train, and they will go off the rails and crash. You naturally want to fix things and get back on track. Maybe you get wrapped up in the emotions of the moment and lash out internally at yourself with doubt and regret or externally at others with blame and anger. This is a battle without any end. As soon as one lousy situation is passed, another comes around the tracks on a collision course. You feel like giving up.

Life will present challenges. There will be an abundance of situations where you will be challenged. You can see them as wrong, get worked up by them, or you can start to view them as challenges. Instead of pushing away and hiding when things go wrong, you can shift into a state of curiosity. Curious about the lessons that can be learned from the challenges. Don't try and hide, instead actively investigate. Life will never bend to your egoistic ideals. If it does, it won't be permeant.

Investigating will show you that you can get better. Look at your misfortunes, look at the particulars of the incident. How did it make you feel?  Did it remind you of something in the past? Have you experienced this before?  Who was involved? Where they a contributor to the misfortune or an innocent bystander? Be honest. Continue in this way of inquiry to see clearly where you, yourself, could make a difference. If there is genuinely nothing you can do, accept the situation.

Accepting doesn't mean giving in. It means having an open acceptance of the situation and letting wisdom work. You can choose to either reject a perceived misfortune which is out of our control or accept it as the path to wisdom and awakening.

You will never be without this opportunity for introspecting misfortunes. The misfortunes of life are what we signed up for at birth. You can develop the skill of looking into the areas where you are ego-grasping - or we can be buffeted by the winds of an unexamined life.

**Methods**

1. The first struggle is to discover and recognize mishaps. Don't pretend there is nothing troubling.
2. Don't lose track of your mindfulness and loving-kindness. You can be big enough to absorb these troubles.
3. Don't close down around your **EGO**. 'All suffering comes through not recognizing ego-clinging as our enemy.'
4. The way you react doesn't have to be fixed. To respond in a new way, you must act in a new way. Don't be so reactive. Don't be in a hurry. Your motivation is connected with your mind, your thoughts, your intentions, and your energies.
6. Expand your vision utilizing generosity. Be grateful for the troubles you have, you can bear them and even have room to take on the problems facing others.
7. Keep your mind free from misconception. Practice with a concentrated mind. As your relationship to your troubles becomes transformed — so are you.
