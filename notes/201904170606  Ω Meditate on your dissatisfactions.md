# Meditate on your dissatisfactions 
(49)

Practice is best moved and helps the most when we work with our hard problems. Problems are the start of your resentments, your dissatisfactions with the way life is. Stop avoiding the these issues. By meditating on your resentments they help point out where clarity is wanted. Resentments and dissatisfactions are our teachers and it is only with awareness and examination can you grow. Be an adult.

Meditate on those close to you. Be careful that special care is given to the people close to you and be sure they don’t lose the preciousness that attracted you to them in the first place.

'Instead of the resentment being an obstacle, it's a reminder.' [^@Chodron:1994a]

'You lose attention most quickly in the areas that you are most sensitive, so pay attention to important relationships and things that especially irritate you.'

[^@Chodron:1994a]: Pema Chödrön (1994): _Start where you are: a guide to compassionate living_, Boston: Shambhala - @Chodron:1994a
