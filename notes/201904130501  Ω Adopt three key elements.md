# Adopt three key elements 
(45)

Adopt, acquire, attain, take on, take up, maintain - these are all admonitions to look clearly and intently at our goals and aspirations. 

The three key elements, conditions, or principle causes referred to in this slogan are the foundational elements of a healthy practice. 

1. Receive guidance from a qualified spiritual mentor - a teacher, maybe could be physically present or on the web or dead or a combination - find your community, your tribe
2. Devote yourself to all stages of practice - have a workable mind - be malleable - taming the mind is of utmost importance - develop intelligence, have enthusiasm
3. Assemble physical and social conditions for practice - adequate economic support

Be aware of the convergence of circumstances in your life - remind yourself that many people do not have such good circumstances. This is an opportunity afforded you as a result of your birth. Don't waste it.
