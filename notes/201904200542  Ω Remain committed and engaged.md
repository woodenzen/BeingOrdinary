# Remain committed and engaged
(52)

There are 6 areas where you should be watchful. Engagement with your understanding. Watch how you present in these areas. Full immersion.   

Don't attend to only half of experience and watch for misplaced intentions. 

1. patience with the outer world but not the inner **Misplaced patience**
2. compassion with in-group but not others (picking and choosing) **Misplaced compassion**
3. yearning for more money and things but not cultivating loving-kindness **Misplaced aspiration**
4. joy in seeing others troubles but not rejoicing in their wholesome deeds **Misplaced savoring**
5. priorities set for self-interest but not practice **Misplaced dedication**
6. excitement with mundane entertainments and not the study of Mind Training **Misplaced rejoicing**

Notice when you get caught by your natural tendency to partially commit and clearly make the effort to move our intentions towards an inclusive, fuller, richer, more meaningful experience

'Don’t misinterpret the slogans, but it may also mean don’t misinterpret what’s going on in your life. Don’t misinterpret what others are saying or doing, don’t misinterpret your own thoughts and actions.'
