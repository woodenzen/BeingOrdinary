# Keep the three inseparable 
(47)


Practice virtue, be upright always. These three inseparables are to be permeated with positive actions.

- When you practice wholeheartedly, it shows in your actions. 
- When you practice wholeheartedly, it shows in the way you relate with your speech. 
- When you practice wholeheartedly, it shows in your thought stream. 

The three are, your actions, your speech, and your thoughts. Keep them inseparable from your commitment to wake up and help others. Practice with this slogan and let it permeate you when doing your routine tasks. Take this slogan into daily life. Let it permeate the world. Inseparable from practice. Be wholesomely motivated. When you do your daily routine tasks with this kind of attention, your whole life becomes your spiritual practice. This brings you and your practice into harmony. No separation.

Don't treat your practice differently in different circumstances. This is like the Stoic slogan 'Settle on type of person I want to be and stick to it, whether alone or in company'. Stick to being an upright person not matter the circumstances.
