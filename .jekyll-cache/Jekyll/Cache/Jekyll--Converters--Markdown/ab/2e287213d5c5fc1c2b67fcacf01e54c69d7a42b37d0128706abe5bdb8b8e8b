<p>(19)</p>

<p>The original slogan is: ‚ÄúAll dharma agrees at one point.‚Äù</p>

<p>The ‚Äòone point‚Äô captures what it means to train the mind. You train your mind by eliminating your self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance. The source of your self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance is the ego, and the ego is an illusion.</p>

<p>To open up to reality. The reality of what just what is.</p>

<p>The amount of self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance is a measure of practice and your level of maturity. Too much and you come off as an arrogant asshole, too little and you can‚Äôt function. Find a balance is hard work and you need less self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance than you think. This work gives purpose to the practice. A real measurable outcome. A target. ‚ÄúOn an optimistic note, if we find that our practice results in decreased your self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance, you can recognize the authenticity of your practice. Practicing in this way distinguishes a true dharma practitioner from one who is merely practicing a facsimile.‚Äù [^@Wallace:2001aa] Try, try, try.</p>

<p>The ego is a distraction. It distracts you from the value available in mindfulness. Out ego, tendencies have developed over our lifetimes influenced by our genes and our social and cultural environment. Over this time, you‚Äôve built defenses that keep the fortress of your ego insulated from how things are, and when reality turns out different, you freak out. You lose control and fear the world is falling. Unfortunately, you see a lot of support for this freaking out behavior from the media.</p>

<p>The way around this is to open up. Not be so stuck on yourself. Learn to be more tender; learn to be a beginner. Give up self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance and integrate this work into daily life.</p>

<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ there is no target for the trio of study, reflection, and meditation to destroy other than this.‚Äù [^@Jinpa:2011aa] Here Thupten Jinpa, quoted from his 2011 book <em>Essential mind training: Tibetan wisdom for daily life</em> is referring to destroying your self-cherishing attitude and self-grasping ignorance.</p>
