<p>(58)</p>

<p>Be involved with the activities of life. Be serious, even when having fun. Like breathing, life experiences come and go all on their own. They can buffet us about. In different situations they have more or less power and is harder to recognize. When having fun, just have fun. When being serious, just be serious. Without making fun or serious anything other that what it is. Don‚Äôt get distracted from the goal of developing loving kindness and seeing through egoistic self-grasping. Don‚Äôt succumb to the impulses and whims of your mood-stream. We are subjected to an ever changing mood stream that includes irritations, slights, inconveniences, highs and lows. This is normal and usual, part of the default mind. Nurture and care for your good intentions.</p>

<p>How do you spend your time? What do you think about? How do you invest your energy? Don‚Äôt confuse the open, child-like mind of meditation with a laissez a faire attitude. 
Frivolity is not a virtue. Also don‚Äôt swing the pendulum and present a ‚Äúoverblown display of seriousness‚Ä¶ The most solemn occasions have an undercurrent of absurdity; and the silliest interactions have an undertone of profundity.‚Äù [^@Leif:2010aa]</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt be like the weather. Be steadfast in working towards your goals. Settle and focus. Don‚Äôt sleepwalk through the day. Neither stability or momentum will develop when you interact unconsciously with your mood-stream.</p>
