<p>No matter what circumstances you find yourself in, good or bad, be patient. ‚ÄúEither way‚Äù points to practicing patience, to being still. Patience with equanimity. See all these circumstances as transient. Watch the good ones fall apart and treat the bad ones are opportunities.</p>

<p>You tend to attach to things that will <em>fall apart</em> (all the impermanent situations of life) and try to distance yourself from life‚Äôs <em>opportunities</em> (the circumstances you consider bad.) Always be patient because when things <em>fall apart, opportunities</em> will arise and visa-versa. These are the constant fluctuations of cyclic existence.</p>

<p>When things <em>fall apart</em> and <em>opportunities</em> present themselves it is not because you made a mistake, it is just the flow of live. You have no control over things outside you mindThat is how life is, it is a long series of change and each time life changes your circumstances change. You do not have any control over this so the best thing for you to do is relax and be patient.</p>

<p>Wait with humble equanimity for whatever happens, rather good or bad. Except it for what that is. Patience is the ballast for the vessel that is your life. Stay focused on your practice.</p>

<p>It is hard to be undistracted and practice steadily. You lose your bearings from time to time. Don‚Äôt let your practice be swayed by the tenor of the current situation no matter how good or bad they are. Situations unfold at their own speed. When you are impatient you closed off the flow of life.</p>

<p>‚ÄòThere is a Zen story about a man whose horse ran away. People said it was bad luck. Then the horse came back, which people thought was good luck, and then his son broke his leg while falling off it and people thought that was bad luck come round again. But because his leg was broken, the man‚Äôs son was saved from being drafted into the army and dying in a war, and the cycle went on and on.‚Äô</p>

<p>Be patient either way and things will change. Endure whichever situation arises, good or bad. Things change. Good turns bad and bad turns good. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see‚Äù is the operative mood here. In the mean time, focus on awaking your mind.</p>
