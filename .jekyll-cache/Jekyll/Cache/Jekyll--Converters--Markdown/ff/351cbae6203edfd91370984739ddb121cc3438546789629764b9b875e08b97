<p>The original slogan is: ‚ÄúFour practices are the best of methods.‚Äù</p>

<p>It would be best if you had both profound religious philosophy and practical tools for daily living.  This goes with the territory of being human. This slogan is fantastic in its straightforwardness and being action-oriented. It lays out four specific practices to incorporate in your everyday life.</p>

<p>Four Practices. (Non-traditional)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do good - generate goodness and compassion</li>
  <li>Avoid evil - avoid leaving a trail of suffering and clear away any negativity</li>
  <li>Appreciate your lunacy - fill obsessions with awareness while learning from mistakes</li>
  <li>Pray for help - seek guidance in nourishing wakefulness in your life</li>
</ol>

<p>Four Practices. (More traditional Tibetan compilations)</p>

<ol>
  <li>make offerings to the deities and the spiritual teachers and supplicating them - accumulate merit</li>
  <li>purify your negative karma - purify the seeds of wrongs</li>
  <li>make offerings to the malevolent forces - make offerings to spirits</li>
  <li>make offerings to the Dharma protectors</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Do good</strong> not to gain merit or recognition. Do good because it is in your true nature to be compassionate. Practice in secret. Don‚Äôt broadcast your intentions or accomplishments. Your ego will want to but resist. The goal here is to help others and not feed your ego. Happiness comes from a kind mind.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid evil</strong> means stop your bad habits that are not healthy, not in your best interests, or not compassionate towards others and yourself. Especially stop your behaviors that cause others anguish. In the past, you have had impure thoughts and actions. Learn not to do this in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Appreciate your lunacy</strong> by inviting and welcoming your problems. They are doing you the favor of pointing to where you can wake up and be compassionate towards your tendencies. Make friends with your demons as they will show up once you get very far down this path of Mind Training. Make the necessary commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Pray for help</strong> can be interrupted as being watchful for those moments when the universe pokes you because you have fallen asleep. It would be best if you swayed your thinking and actions towards doing good and avoiding evil.</p>

<p>Resistance and forgetfulness are the hindrances to these four practices. They are not difficult if we remember to practice them. When practiced, each will bring you closer to awareness of your present moment experience. Take refuge in a path.</p>
