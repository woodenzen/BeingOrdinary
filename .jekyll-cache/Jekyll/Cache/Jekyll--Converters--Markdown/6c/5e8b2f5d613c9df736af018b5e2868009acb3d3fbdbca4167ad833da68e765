<p>(34)</p>

<p>This slogan is about how we sometimes try to weasel out of your duties and responsibilities. Donâ€™t transfer your challenging tasks and those tasks that you donâ€™t want to do to those who are not equipped and cannot handle them. You are supposed to be reducing friction, removing barriers, and sorting things out, not inflating your sense of being unique.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This doesnâ€™t mean that you donâ€™t share your problems or seek support when you are struggling. If youâ€™re not strong and you need help, then you should ask for it. Thereâ€™s probably an ox around somewhere who will share your burden.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The antidote is to be happy you can carry the weight you do. Be glad that you are skilled enough to handle these challenges. Part of learning to not unload on others is developing the skill of â€˜playing well with othersâ€™. You can ask others to help, but donâ€™t empty your burden on them. Recognize your role and what you are here to contribute to the flow of life, not to stifle it by shifting your burden onto those who arenâ€™t equipped to handle it.</p>
