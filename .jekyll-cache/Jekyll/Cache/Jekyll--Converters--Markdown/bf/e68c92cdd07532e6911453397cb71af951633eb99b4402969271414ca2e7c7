<p>(23)</p>

<p>Always come back and recommit yourself to this simple practice. Don‚Äôt just focus on working with your own mind but also attend to how you practice in the presence of others. Your interactions reveal a lot about your practice.</p>

<p>The original slogan is: ‚ÄúAlways abide by the three basic principles.‚Äù</p>

<p>Basically the three principles or elements are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain intention to train your mind.
    <ul>
      <li>Stick to your guns and remember to keep practicing. You will get distracted and lose track of your intention to train your mind but don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt beet yourself up for getting distracted either. Simply start again as if this was the first moment of practice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Apply good manners, and be kind, humble, and wise.
    <ul>
      <li>Be careful not to let your life be corrupted by egotistic self-grasping. You are not special and the people your meet and interact with are on a journey much like yours. You and them are not different. Kindness is your religion. Thinking somehow above the crowd and to seek attention, cooing and hawing about your accomplishments is counter being humble and wise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be even tempered, balanced, unbiased, develop patience.
    <ul>
      <li>Be the tortoise and not the hare. This practice is really about focusing on the journey and not rushing. There is a lot to do and no need to hurry. This isn‚Äôt an easy or popular way of life and there are no guaranties that you‚Äôll achieve any kind of mastery. No rush to get to the next moment. The day will arrive at its own pace. There is enough practice for four lifetimes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All life is impermanent. You live for and with others. Suffering and confusion pervade the universe. The reality is that your practice is situated in life.</p>

<p>Love your mind training practice more than you love cooperating with you own egotistic self-grasping.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄòThe fast track to spiritual maturity is through total commitment, intelligent practice, and perseverance. Any short cut that bypasses these elements is bogus.‚Äô[]</p>
