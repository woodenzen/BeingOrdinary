<p>(31)</p>

<p>If I don‚Äôt have anything nice to say, don‚Äôt say anything at all. It‚Äôs better to be quiet rather than put feeble opinions out in the universe. You don‚Äôt have a clear picture of others or even have a clear picture of yourself. Your words are your choice. Words are powerful. Use them wisely.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt talk smack! Keep your thoughts to yourself, even when attacked. Resisting going on autopilot and making a snap remark is not easy. Saying awful stuff about others is a reflection of your feelings, insecurity, and frustration. If you say things insulting about someone, those present will think you‚Äôll say things insulting about them behind their backs. You might develop a non-virtuous character habit. Every little bit of gossip and verbal snipping adds up and can be of substantial consequence. This type of meanness is contagious.</p>

<p>The slogan ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt poison yourself‚Äù reminds you not to poison yourself, but it‚Äôs just as important not to poison others. Examine intentions before you speak. Do your choices come out of kindness? Is your purpose of being helpful?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we say something, we should ask ourselves why we are saying it, and for what purpose. Will what we say help the situation or not? Are we trying to connect with someone or get rid of them? Are we trying to help them or to destroy them? Not maligning does not mean that we do not notice differences in people. Everything does not just become a mush. - Judy Lief [^@Leif:2010aa]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Treat talk that appears to be malicious with patience and understand that they‚Äôd act better if people knew better. As you grow and learn, you become more able to be present, so it is with others. We all have different levels of understanding, and we are developing and changing. At one time, you didn‚Äôt have this understanding, now you do. Others may not be here yet.</p>
