<p>Make practice your whole life. There are just two mental states. Being present and being distracted from being present. In the beginning, practice is .01% being present, and the 99.99% distracted, and as we continue to practice, the ratio shifts. After many years of training, the ratio might become 20% present, and 80% distracted. Simply knowing this and that you don‚Äôt have to be perfect lightens the situation. It‚Äôs not that practice is directed, earnest, and serious and that distractions are something else. They both together make up your life. Use them to support your practice as reminders, signals, calls to the practice.</p>

<p>The original slogan is: ‚ÄúIf you can practice even when distracted, you are well trained.‚Äù The first step is noticing you are distracted. Right there, in the noticing, you are practicing. If you don‚Äôt see your distractions, you are not practicing, you are what we say ‚Äúthinking without knowing you are thinking.‚Äù Welcome your distractions as they are guides to help you bring back to awareness.</p>

<p>What do you do with all these distractions? They are the practice. By merely noticing you‚Äôre in a distracted state, suddenly, you‚Äôre no longer distracted but practicing. It is like coming back to the breath. The simple act of noticing your distraction is the heart of the practice. Simply knowing one‚Äôs mental and physical state and focusing one‚Äôs attention on the present moment experience restart your practice. It is a tool for practice. In Zen, we have a saying: ‚ÄúWhen you fall down on the ground, you use the ground to get up.‚Äù Distraction is one of the essential flavors of life.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt make a mistake most people make, not continuing practice when things get distracting, and there‚Äôs no distraction like human relationships.</p>
