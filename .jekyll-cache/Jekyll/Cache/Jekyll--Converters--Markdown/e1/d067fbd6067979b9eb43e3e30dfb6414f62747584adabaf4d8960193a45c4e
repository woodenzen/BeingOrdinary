<p>(21)</p>

<p>The original slogan is: “Always maintain only a joyful mind.”</p>

<p>A nurturing mature practice develops a deep and quietly joyful mind that exposes itself. Keep your sense of humor around your own thoughts and feelings. Remember, having a bigger perspective leads to joy. Be inspired and encouraged. The development of your joyful mind as the path to awakening.</p>

<p>This seems like a self-centered and simplistic thing to suggest “always maintain only a joyful mind.” It may be hard to consider this when you are suffering. Here you are encouraged to be open to the possibility of a joyful mind and not to delude yourself or put on a false smile. Don’t take anything too seriously.</p>

<p>Joy is often explained as favorable karmic circumstances. Still, this kind of joy in everyday life, and the present moment are the natural byproduct of the positive feedback loop of practice and service. Not being tied to karma, this joyfulness is independent of circumstances and has the feeling of being connected.</p>
