<p>(35)</p>

<p>Society tends to rush things, which turns everything into a competitive race. Even love can become a competition. We can get caught up in hurrying from one experience to another.</p>

<p>What are we racing forward into the future? What does â€˜racing forward into the futureâ€™ mean? Who is in a hurry, and to what end?</p>

<p>Donâ€™t turn your meditation practice into a speed competition. You can not meditate faster than anyone else. Meditation isnâ€™t about being first or ahead of someone else, and itâ€™s not about being more spiritual than others. The results of your practice come to you in their own sweet time.</p>

<p>Rushing things often means wanting to be first, striving to be the fastest, most knowledgeable, most liked.</p>

<p>There is no need to hurry. Just let things happen at their own pace. Move at the pace of life, and donâ€™t try to speed things up. Moving at the speed of life is what it means to act naturally, according to nature.</p>

<p>Speed is not the answer. What doesnâ€™t get finished wonâ€™t get finished. There will be somethings in life left unfinished. Except for this reality and move forward with joy and kindness. There are no external urgencies, only internally imposed pressure. Relax, try to move at a slower, more natural pace. There is plenty of time for practice. Practice steadily, not fast.</p>

<p>Our lifetime will end soon enough, no need to rush to bring that eventuality about. You are not in a race with anyone. Any sense of the need to hurry is a self-imposed silly fixation on accomplishment,  a way for the ego to make itself known. It is improper and hurtful to push your way into the limelight. Especially when undeserved.</p>

<p>Slogan practice is about developing awareness and compassion. Taking what you learn and experience off the cushion and into everyday daily life.</p>
