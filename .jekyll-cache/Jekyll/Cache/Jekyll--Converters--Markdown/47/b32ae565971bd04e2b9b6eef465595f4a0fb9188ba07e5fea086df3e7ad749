<p>(50)</p>

<p>Bring all experiences into the path. Positive and negative. Rich and not so rich. Keep an open spirit and embrace challenges presented by your circumstances. Let them become aids to your spiritual practice.</p>

<p>What is meant by “embrace”?</p>

<ul>
  <li>being flexible, but rooted and strong</li>
  <li>not vacillating between wanting and repelling</li>
  <li>developing a mature ‘other focused’ attitude</li>
  <li>acknowledging influences</li>
  <li>seeing the positive in life’s situations</li>
  <li>operating within your locus of control</li>
  <li>focusing on long term vs short term intentions</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t give circumstances control. Don’t wait for the right circumstances. Don’t be swayed by circumstances. Don’t treat Mind Training differently in different circumstances. All circumstances nurture this practice. This is reminiscent of the Stoic slogan ‘Settle on type of person I want to be and stick to it, whether alone or in company’. Stick to being an upright person not matter the circumstances. “The only rearrangement that needs to be made is to your own attitude.” [^@Leif:2010aa]</p>

<p>Start before you think you are ready. Dive in. Inertia is so important. Waiting for circumstances to be what you think will be favorable is time wasted and the circumstances may never seem favorable. Embrace life. Move, learn, correct, move again.</p>

<p>There is aways a glimmer of sunshine in every event. Just grab it. In the film <em>‘Life is Beautiful</em>, Giorgio Cantarini, who played the father, was being marched off to the gas chamber and he did a funny march so his son could see that even in this moment of tragedy there was the opportunity to smile if you took it.</p>
