<p>(38)</p>

<p>This slogan is about exploiting others for your benefit in order to gratify your self-grasping ego. Finding happiness or wishing for personal gain in the suffering of other is antithetical to practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is important that those who do harm stop doing that and that we or someone, when possible, sees to it that that stopping occurs. But this isnâ€™t the same as revenge or enjoying anotherâ€™s pain. As we have seen, compassion, real compassion, canâ€™t be selective. [^@Fischer:2013aa]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ego can be sneaky and we may not be aware how out good fortunes are the result of other peoples suffering. In the food economy there is a lot of exploitation going on most of which is hidden from view in farm fields and orchards. In the apparel economy the exploitation is hidden off shore in small and large factories. Societies are built on exploitation. This is impossible to escape. Even so we must strive to be fair and compassionate in our dealings in the economy and with others.</p>

<p>Live life not as a Zero-Sum game but instead as an Infinite-Game where everyone can experience wins leading to wins. We really do want everyone to be happy and healthy.</p>

<p>Build your happiness on the goal of supporting everyones happiness and donâ€™t support exploitation where you discover it. You want to thrive and see others thrive.</p>
