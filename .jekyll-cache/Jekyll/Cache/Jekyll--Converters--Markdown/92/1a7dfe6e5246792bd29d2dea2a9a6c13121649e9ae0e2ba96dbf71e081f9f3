<p>(44)</p>

<p>The first challenge is being aware enough to notice negative emotions arising. The second challenge is overcoming those negative emotions once they have arisen and then to get some separation between the automaticity of habitual energies and the intention to release self-cherishing ego. The third challenge is the eradication of negative emotions so they don‚Äôt return.</p>

<p>In short; notice, stop, breath and return.</p>

<p>The three challenges:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Negative habitual impulses arise so quickly they are hard to catch. Acknowledge to yourself when caught by habitual impulses. Recognize neurosis. It take practice and concentration otherwise the arising of emotions escape your attention.</li>
  <li>Once identified it is hard to know what to do and not stumble and fallow the arising negative habitual pattern. Choose to do something different than what hasn‚Äôt worked in the past. Apply antidote.</li>
  <li>Keep a vigilance for the next time and determine not to follow habitual impulses.</li>
</ol>

<p>‚ÄúThe first difficulty is when the habitual impulse first appears in your mind, the moment when it first pops up. Can you notice it? The second difficulty is the once it appears, it is compelling and very difficult to let go of. Can you let go? The third difficulty is the even if you can let go, it is hard not to be compelled by it all over again when it pops up again next time because of the force of the residual habit energy that you‚Äôve been putting into it all of this time. Can you let go again and again, with patience?‚Äù [^@Fischer:2013aa]</p>
