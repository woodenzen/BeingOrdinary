<p>(14)</p>

<p>Originally ‚ÄúSeeing confusion as the four <em>kayas</em> is unsurpassable <em>shunyata</em> protection.‚Äù</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs break this down and look at the confusion and what it tries to protect us from.</p>

<p>Underneath the technical jargon, this slogan is about interdependence and how your ordinary mind is already Buddha mind. <em>Kayas</em> represent the progression of the evolution of our perceptions. This progression from confusion to awakening traditionally is defined in Buddhism with the four <em>Kayes</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>dharmakaya - begins with uncertainty and openness</li>
  <li>nirmanakaya - your perception then starts to come into focus</li>
  <li>sambkogakaya - then develops energy and begins to come together</li>
  <li>svabhavikakaya - synthesizes into the immediate present-moment experience</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Shunyata</em> is referred to in Buddhism as emptiness. The background of being. That place before thoughts and feelings. That place (which is no place) where your thoughts dissipate when you notice them. Sometimes mistakenly called <em>the center</em>. But it has no location. This is what is meant by emptiness.</p>

<p>All of reality erupts from this <em>place of emptiness</em>. Your mistake is to take what appears as reality and make it separate, reliable, and unchanging. You separate perceptions into subject and object - you the subject and the world the object. This reinforces the ego and causes of confusion. What this slogan tells you is that even this confusion and the associated suffering erupts from the same <em>place of emptiness</em>.</p>

<p>Both object and subject are illusory, arising from emptiness and residing in emptiness and returning to emptiness. Seeing the arising, residing, and disappearing of experience is what is meant by awakening confusion. Don‚Äôt worry or stress about this. The nature of the universe is just like this, arising, residing, and returning, drop it, and rest in emptiness.</p>

<p>All experience is both vivid and empty, arising and returning to that <em>place of emptiness</em>. There is no hanging on to experience, no matter how much you try.  Experience your life this way. Practice awakening paired with letting go.</p>

<p>Practice emptiness means you practice with the ultimate Bodhicitta. The nature of the universe. Don‚Äôt worry or stress about this. Just see all your confusion as to the path and continue to sit and investigate. Indeed this is your best protection.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn other words, you can just drop it. Out of the blue, you just drop it.
The world opens up and suddenly you‚Äôre there for what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù [^@Chodron:1994a]</p>
