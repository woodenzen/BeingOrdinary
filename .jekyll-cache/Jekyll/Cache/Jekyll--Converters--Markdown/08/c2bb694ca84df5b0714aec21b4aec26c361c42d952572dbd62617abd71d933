<p>Donâ€™t lose track of what? What is being referred to here are the three key elements that form the foundations for a healthy practice. Framed as once developed, however imperfectly, donâ€™t let them wane. Keep tract. They are expressed as devotion, appreciation, and discipline.</p>

<p>In a healthy practice you look to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Receive guidance from a qualified spiritual mentor</li>
  <li>Assemble physical and social conditions for practice</li>
  <li>Devote yourself to all stages of practice</li>
</ol>

<p>Remain vigilant for laps in devotion, appreciation, and discipline.
Pay attention to the ups and downs of your inspiration.
Here the corresponding admonishments are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be devotion to your spiritual friend</li>
  <li>Be grateful for the Mind Training slogans</li>
  <li>By conducting yourself with grace and dignity</li>
</ol>

<p>Be vigilant in how you conduct yourself in order to keep tract of the three key elements.</p>
