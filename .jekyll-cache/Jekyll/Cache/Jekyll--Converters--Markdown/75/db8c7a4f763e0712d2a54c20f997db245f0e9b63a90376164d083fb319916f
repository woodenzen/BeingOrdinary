The original slogan is: ‚ÄúPractice the five strengths, the condensed heart instructions.‚Äù This slogan is about working at cultivating your true nature to be more compassionate and open. Instructions for doing the work of being a human.</p>

<p>This is framed as five strengths. Consider them to be habits to be developed. Practice habits can be integrated into your life in a multitude of ways.  The critical point is that you commit to working on each. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. You want to strive to be 1% better than yesterday. Be the best you can be with the skills you have. This is a serious project. One that requires a balance between being firm and being relaxed. One that requires time, focus, and patience.</p>
